# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide was developed for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains
notes on HTML, CSS, git and JavaScript. Developing this web page for boot camp students taught and allowed me to implement the web development fundamentals and the importance of git workflow.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide web page can be used to as a refresher for HTML, CSS and JavaScript syntax. It can also be used as a sort of cheat sheet for git commands if one needs a quick reminder. If the DevTools console is opened on the browser, JavaScript is running in the background which lists the topic learned during the prework and chooses one topic to revise from first.
